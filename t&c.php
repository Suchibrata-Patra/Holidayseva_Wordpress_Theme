CONTENT MODERATION
Guest Review Moderation Guidelines

We only accept customer reviews from customers who have booked and completed a hotel stay with us. Occasionally, we may also obtain and display customer reviews from other third-party service providers. Reviews may include a rating, text, and/or images.
All the reviews submitted by customers are initially auto-moderated. The reviews that do not pass the auto-moderation check due to various reasons, like suspected fraud reviews, irrelevant reviews, comments containing profanity, etc. are manually moderated.



While manually moderating reviews, we make the best efforts to ensure that the intent, meaning, or the language of the review is not changed. This means that neither will the reviews get edited for grammar, spellings, sentence construction, use of abbreviations, nor will it be edited to make it more comprehensible. We understand that customers are not professional writers, and any change in the content makes the reviews look fake and fabricated.



We make reasonable efforts to detect fake reviews. We reserve the right to delete and investigate any review we have reason to believe is fake. We may also cease showing reviews of a property if the management of the property changes.



We make no representation or warranty regarding the accuracy, genuineness, or veracity of any review. Anyone who relies on such reviews does so at their own risk.



Moderation Guidelines for Content Only Reviews

Both positive and negative reviews are accepted if they appear to be genuine.
Reviews are accepted EXACTLY the way they are written by customers. The review content is not checked for grammar, spelling, and punctuation.
Rating Only reviews are accepted.
Words or phrases in a review that include any abusive or inappropriate language, character assassinating comments, hotel price, comparison between hotels and competitor OTAs, or any controversial statements or comments, which are insensitive or can hurt people's religious sentiments are removed. The review may be accepted with the remaining content.
Reasonable efforts are made to ensure that reviews in all the regional languages are accepted. An English translation (through any available online tools) of the content is added if the review is in any other regional/national language except for Hindi.
What kind of reviews are rejected?

Duplicate Reviews: Only the two most recent reviews shared by a customer are accepted while the others are rejected. This is done to prevent fraudulent reviews from coming in.
No Check-in Review: A review is rejected if a customer cancels the booking, does not receive any hotel booking confirmation, or does not show up at the hotel.
Fake Review: Reviews posted through a travel agent's email ID and non-booking reviews are rejected. There is a fraud check in the auto-moderation flow as well.
Irrelevant Review: Reviews which don't mention anything specific about the hotel stay experience are rejected/modified to that extent. For example: "wait for reviews on the way", "I have lost my winter jacket.", or hotel reviews which seek to penalise the hotel for the booking process handled by the online OTA.
Hotel Rules Issue: A review is rejected if a customer is not allowed to check-in due to a breach of the hotel rules and policies.
Review about Another Hotel: Reviews with feedback on any other hotel, and not where the customer stayed, are rejected.
Suspicious Reviews: Reviews which, in the reasonable opinion of the company, appear suspicious are rejected.


Moderation Guidelines for Image Reviews

All the guest images undergo an auto-moderation process. Images that are not approved reflect in the manual queue and are moderated basis the guidelines below.


What kind of images are accepted?

Images which focus mainly on the room, bathroom, interior, reception area, dining hall, banquet hall, or any other hotel facility/amenity/premises are accepted.

What kind of replies are rejected?
